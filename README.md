## Business Overview
Apex Logistics, a global supply chain company specializing in delivering sporting goods and equipment worldwide. The company partners with 10 key suppliers from countries like the USA, Canada, and Germany to streamline operations and provide timely deliveries. In 2024 alone, Apex Logistics handled over 50,000 shipments across various regions, generating $107 million in sales. However, in recent months, the leadership team noticed rising complaints about delayed shipments, with nearly 45% of total shipments arriving late. These delays have affected customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, leading to a potential loss of $48,775 in delayed sales. With increasing operational complexity and higher product demand, Apex Logistics is seeking a solution to reduce late shipments, identify supply chain bottlenecks, and improve overall delivery performance.

* Uncovered opportunities to improve profitability by highlighting low-efficiency products and patterns in delayed shipments.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
* On-time delivery rates
* Supplier performance
* Product profitability
* Shipment delays across various dimensions (product categories, order dates, delivery types)

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
* Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights.
* Utilized Power BI's advanced visualization features to create dynamic reports with drill-down and filtering capabilities by product, supplier, and delivery type.
* Implemented data modeling and DAX formulas to clean and aggregate data for accurate analysis.
* Employed advanced Power Query techniques to transform raw data for easier analysis and ensure data integrity.
* Automated data refreshes to keep the dashboard up-to-date, providing executives with real-time information for decision-making.
