The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard to monitor and analyze KPIs related to shipments and deliveries. The goal is to identify inefficiencies in the supply chain, improve supplier performance, and enhance overall customer satisfaction by providing actionable insights that drive data-driven decisions.

**Business Problem**

**A) Problem Identification:**
  The company was facing significant challenges with its shipment and delivery processes, including frequent delays and inconsistencies in order fulfillment. These issues were leading to customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue, and inefficiencies in supplier management.
  
**B) Business Impact:** 
  Delayed shipments were eroding customer trust and loyalty, resulting in a decline in repeat business and potential long-term revenue loss. Additionally, the lack of visibility into supplier performance and shipment data made it difficult for the company to optimize its operations, leading to increased operational costs and decreased profitability.

**Methodology**

**A) Data Cleaning and Transformation:** 
  The project began with the extraction of raw shipment and delivery data from multiple sources. The data was then cleaned to remove inconsistencies, duplicate records, and irrelevant information. Data transformation processes were applied to standardize formats and ensure that the data was suitable for analysis. Key metrics such as order dates, delivery times, sales amounts, and supplier details were accurately structured to feed into the dashboard.
  
**B) Analysis Techniques:**

Visual Analytics: Various visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and donut charts, were used to represent the data, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in shipment performance.

Descriptive Analysis: Key metrics like total orders, sales amounts, on-time deliveries, delayed orders, and average delivery days were calculated to provide a high-level overview of the companyâ€™s shipment operations.

Comparative Analysis: The dashboard enabled comparisons between on-time and delayed deliveries, different suppliers, and product performance to identify areas that required attention and improvement.

**Results and Business Recommendation**

**A) Business Impact:**
The implementation of the PowerBI dashboard led to a significant improvement in the company's shipment and delivery performance. On-time deliveries increased, supplier accountability improved, and overall customer satisfaction was enhanced. The insights provided by the dashboard enabled the company to optimize its supply chain operations, reduce costs, and improve profitability.

**B) Insights:**
Supplier Performance: The dashboard revealed that certain suppliers consistently underperformed in terms of on-time deliveries. This insight led to renegotiations and stricter performance metrics, resulting in better overall supplier reliability.

Product Profitability: Analysis of sales amounts and profits by product helped the company focus on high-margin products, driving better inventory management and marketing efforts.

Delivery Efficiency: By understanding the distribution of on-time versus delayed shipments, the company was able to re-evaluate and optimize its delivery processes, reducing the average delivery time and enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Skills**

Tools: PowerBI, Microsoft Excel
Languages: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), SQL (for data extraction and transformation)
Software: PowerBI for data visualization and reporting, Excel for preliminary data analysis and cleaning

**Next Steps**

A) Future Work:
Predictive Analytics: Integrate machine learning models into the dashboard to predict shipment delays based on historical data and real-time factors, enabling proactive management.
Automation: Automate data extraction and transformation processes to ensure the dashboard always reflects the most current data, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.
Enhanced Supplier Management: Develop a supplier scorecard within the dashboard to track and evaluate supplier performance over time, facilitating continuous improvement and strategic partnerships.
